### Mood Ring is an interactive mirror that illuminates based on your mood.

See [my blog](http://www.blog.calebfergie.com/2018/12/04/mood-ring/) for more information.

#### Created using:
1. An express app with the EJS view
2. The facial recognition program within the [clmtracker library made by auduno](https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr)
3. An arduino with the neopixel library, connected to the express app through serial communication (node & serial)


#### More info

Most of the customized code in this project can be found in the arduino folder and the `mood-ring.ejs` file in the `views` folder

How to use this code:
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the project folder in your command line tool and run `npm install`
3. Upload the code in the 'Arduino code' folder to your arduino
4. Start serving the express app by using `node bin/www` (or alternatively `nodemon bin/www` for automatic reloading)
5. Open a browser and navigate to `localhost:3000`
6. Press the 'start' button to start tracking and sending values to the arduino

Not working? Changes you may need to make:
1. Number of pixels, pin of LED strip (arduino code)
2. Name of USB port of arduino (index.js)
3. Thresholds of emotion recognition (mood-ring.ejs)
